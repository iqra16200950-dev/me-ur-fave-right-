# 💌 Me? Ur Fave? Right… 👀

Hello, fellow human being.
Welcome to a cute little interactive webpage built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — made for all the cuties out there.
This project features an interactive envelope 💌. When you click it, it reveals a **VERY important question**:
> **“Am I ur favorite?”**
Now here’s the twist…
If the user dares to press **“No”**, the button starts running away.
(Not literally, of course — it just moves around the screen 😌)
Eventually, the user has no choice but to press **“Yes.”**
And thus, victory is achieved.
(muhahaha – evil laugh) <3
